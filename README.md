@samroedl Final Project Memory Game

DESCRIPTION OF GAME:

For the final project, i made the attempt at creating a memory game where there were two levels of varying difficulty where you had to initially press the button to start the game. Then follows is a prompt on the screen to prepare the player for the game and then they will be presented with the first level where they are given a series of four lights they have to memorize. They then will have to answer the prompt on the screen and if they are successful they will move on to the next level that moves much faster and adds an additiponl light. If they are successufl they will be prompted that tey have completed the game.
